========= VERSION 2.0 =========================================

Lots of changes to the user interface:
	Changed the entire flow to a less linear style.
	Implemented keyword search for levels.
	Added the option to save randomization presets.


========= VERSION 1.2 (pre-release) ===========================

Fundamentally changed the way object groups are defined. Definitions now support the following operators (lowest to highest precedence):
	AND operator (&): Creates the overlap of two groups. E&G creates a group of all objects that are both Enemies and Ghosts.
	Difference (-): Removes all element of one group from the other. I-O creates a group of all Invisible that are not harmful (i.e. invisible blocks).
	Combination (+): Combines two groups. Useful for low precedence. E&G+I-O creates a group of both ghost enemies and invisible blocks.
	Parenthesis: (E&G)(I-O) is another way to write the group of both ghost enemies and invisible blocks.

The following groups were changed:
	Elementals (2:18 and 2:19) were moved from Common Enemies to Big Hologram Enemies
	Friendlies now includes Knytt (to get the old Friendlies, use F-K)
	Invisible Enemies was expanded to Invisible
		(including springs and invisible blocks)
		(to get the old Invisible Enemies, use I&O)
	Big Hologram Enemies is now B, and Key Locks is now J
	Waterfalls no longer includes ground splash tiles (1:6, 1:13, and 1:16)
	Liquid now describes all liquid, including liquid base and waterfalls
		(the old Liquid is now in a group called Liquid Surface)
	Liquid surface and liquid base tiles were moved from Literally Everything to All
	Sinrevah (5:1) was moved from Friendlies to Enemies
The following groups were redefined:
	Enemies is now all things that kill Juni that are not Liquids, Spikes, Invisible, or Lasers
	Common Enemies is now all Enemies that are not Ghosts, Hologram Enemies, Big Hologram Enemies, or 8:17
	Liquid Surface (formerly Liquid) is now all Liquids that are Ouchies.
The following groups were added:
	Solid Blocks
	Ouchies (O): Anything that harms Juni, including water, explosions, invisible death tiles, etc.
	KS+ collectables (+): Coins, artifacts, and golden creatures.
	Golden Creatures (*)
	Empty Space (_): Useful for moving objects to random locations (shuffle) or deleting unwanted objects.
The following groups were removed:
	The Kitchen Sink: Essentially a collection of leftovers. It can now be obtained with A-BDFIOPSVW
	Liquid Base: The purpose served by this group is now mostly served by Solid Blocks. The old Liquid Base can still be obtained with L&solidblocks
